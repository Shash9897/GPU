# GPU
A CUDA C++ implementation of a high-throughput Sobel edge detector with optional Gaussian denoising stage. The project demonstrates practical CUDA kernel design, shared memory tiling, and CPU/GPU benchmarking on large images. It includes command-line controls for block/grid size, kernel choices, and multiple image.
